SimonGame is an algorithm that implements the classic memory game Simon, where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors shown by the computer. The algorithm uses a Windows Form with four buttons, each representing a color: red, blue, yellow, and green. The algorithm also uses a timer to control the blinking of the buttons, and a random number generator to create the sequence of colors. The algorithm also displays the score and a game over message on the form.

The algorithm is written in C#, an object-oriented and cross-platform programming language. To run the algorithm, you need to have the .NET Framework1 or the .NET Core installed on your system. Moreover, you need to have an IDE or a text editor that supports the C# language, such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code or MonoDevelop.

To use the algorithm, follow these steps:

- Clone or download the GitHub repository of the project.
- Open the file Form1.cs with your IDE or text editor.
- Compile and run the code.
- The algorithm will show a Windows Form with four buttons, a label for the score, and a start button.
- Click the start button to begin the game.
- The algorithm will show a sequence of colors by blinking the buttons.
- Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown by the algorithm.
- If you click the correct button, the algorithm will add one more color to the sequence and show it again.
- If you click the wrong button, the algorithm will display a game over message and stop the game.
- You can start a new game by clicking the start button again.

The algorithm is distributed under the MIT license, which allows the use, modification and distribution of the code to anyone, as long as the same license is maintained and the authorship of the original author is recognized. The algorithm is based on the concept of Simon, which is a popular electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978.
